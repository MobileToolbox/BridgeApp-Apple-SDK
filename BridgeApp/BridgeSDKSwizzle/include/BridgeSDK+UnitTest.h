/**
 Registering mocks using `SBBComponentManager` only appears to work if you are running unit tests
 with an app set up as the test harness. When setting up unit tests without this, the shared singletons
 do not get set up correctly. Since there is a bunch of unit tests that are assuming that those singletons
 are set up, I found that the quickest path to not crashing w/o using BridgeSDK.SBBBridgeTestHarness
 was to swizzle the getters. (syoung 11/11/2021)
